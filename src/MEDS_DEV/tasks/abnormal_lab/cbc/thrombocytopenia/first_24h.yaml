  description: >-
    This task predicts whether the patient will have low _platelets_ values (thrombocytopenia) within the next
    24 hours, given the first 24 hours of their admission to the hospital. To be included, 1) patients must
    have at least one measurement for _platelets_ within the next 24 hours after their admission to the
    hospital, 2) patients must not have shown low _platelets_ values previously, and 3) their length of stay
    in the hospital must be at least 48 hours.
