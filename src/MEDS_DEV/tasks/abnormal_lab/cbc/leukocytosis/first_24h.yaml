  description: >-
    This task predicts whether the patient will have high _WBC_ values (leukocytosis) within the next 24
    hours, given the first 24 hours of their admission to the _hospital_. To be included, 1) patients must
    have at least one measurement for _WBC_ within the next 24 hours after their admission to the hospital, 2)
    patients must not have shown high _WBC_ values previously, and 3) their length of stay in the hospital
    must be at least 48 hours.
