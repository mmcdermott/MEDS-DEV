  description: >-
    This task predicts whether the patient will have elevated _creatinine_ values within the next 24
    hours, given the first 24 hours of their admission to the _hospital_. To be included, 1) patients
    must have at least one measurement for _creatinine_ within the next 24 hours after their
    admission to the hospital, 2) patients must not have shown elevated _creatinine_ values
    previously, and 3) their length of stay in the hospital must be at least 48 hours.
